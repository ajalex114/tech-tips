Did you know that you could move windows across monitors using your keyboard?

You don't have to click and drag you window across screens anymore.  

The key is `Windows Key + Shift + <Left/Right>` based on which direction you need to go.  
The best thing is that it maintains the state of your current window.  
If it is already _Maximized_, it will remain so.  
If it will snapped to the left, it will remain snapped to the left on the next screen.  

You can find more windows shortcuts at the Microsoft documentation [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts).
