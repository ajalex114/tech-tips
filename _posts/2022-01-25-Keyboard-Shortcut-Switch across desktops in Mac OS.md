Here's another one for Mac OS.  

You can switch between Virtual Desktops using this keyboard shortcut.

`Ctrl + Right Arrow` to go right.  
`Ctrl + Left Arrow` to go left.  

Please note that this works only for the monitor/screen that has been selected.  

To give more context, unlike in Windows, in Mac OS Virtual Desktops are dependant on the monitors/screens.  
To gain focus of a screen merely having focus on an application is not always enough, you must click your mouse on that screen to gain mouse focus (_I made up this word_). 

So, when you use the above shortcuts, you move between Virtual Desktops of the selected monitor only.

_Note: I'm using MacOS Monterey_
